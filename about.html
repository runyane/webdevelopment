        <p>
          Hello and welcome. I’m El, an educator and aspiring instructional
          designer. I discovered an interest in digital creation early in life.
          As a young adult, I used to design basic websites on GeoCities. I find
          the ability to render documents digitally fascinating.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at The University of Memphis, I enjoyed document
          design. Content creation has become more than just a hobby. However,
          it was the MAT licensure program that inspired me to learn more about
          instructional design.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a professional, I love the process of creating content and
          designing documents. My understanding of document design helps me
          regularly improve my teaching practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not trying to design the perfect document, I am a moderate
          crafter. I make a range of small projects from quilts to paintings. My
          philosophy is to make education practical and enjoyable. Ultimately, I
          want to develop my skills to support my students better. I look
          forward to getting to know everyone.
        </p>
